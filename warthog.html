                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae. They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus</p>
 

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthog at pen E31, right next to the pizza store.</p>
